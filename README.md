# Hatsukoi_Font
A repository to quickly download "Hatsukoi-Regular," a font modified from M+'s MN Type-1 font to work with most visual novels.

Originally modified to work with Hatsukoi 1/1 due to a missing glyph, the font will be updated every now and then to work with any visual novel that supports external font usage.

Below are the variants available.

## Hatsukoi-Regular.ttf
For use with visual novel engines that normally support custom font usage.

## Sukix2Custom.ttf (Edited)
For use with MangaGamer's "If You Love Me, Then Say So!" VN running the Majiro Engine. May work with other localized Majiro Engine titles.
