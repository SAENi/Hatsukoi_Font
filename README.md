# Hatsukoi_Font
A repository to quickly download "Hatsukoi-Regular," a font modified from M+'s MN Type-1 font to work with most visual novels.

Originally modified to work with Hatsukoi 1/1 due to a missing glyph, the font will be updated every now and then to wrok with any visual novel that supports external font usage.
